                        <h3>Get your exercise</h3><br>
                        <p>Regular exercise is probably the closest we can get to a fountain of youth. According to the National Cancer Institute, regular exercise helps control weight, maintain healthy bones, muscles, and joints, and reduces our risk of
                            high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes.</p>

                        <h3>Always eat breakfast</h3><br>
                        <p>Research shows that people who have breakfast tend to take in more vitamins and minerals and less fat and cholesterol. Eating things that are high in fiber and proteins keeps you feeling full and energized. These include whole-grain
                            cereals and breads, low-fat milk, fruit, and yogurt.</p>

                        <h3>Stay Hydrated</h3>
                        <p>Getting the proper amount of water is extremely important as every cell, tissue, and organ in our bodies needs water. Traditionally we’re told we need eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, an amount that’s never been substantiated
                            medically.
                        </p>

                        <img class="z" src="d.jpeg">
                        <h3>Don’t neglect dental hygiene</h3>
                        <p>At the end of a long day, how many take the time to floss? Some studies indicate that regular flossing could add over 6 years to your life. Why? The theory is that the bacteria that produce dental plaque enter the bloodstream and
                            are somehow associated with inflammation that blocks blood vessels and causes heart disease. So, get in the habit of giving your teeth a good bedtime flossing and add years to your life.</p>
